        SILICA perform the judge task according to the data configuration of the contest. <br />
        A contest consists of several problems, and a problem consists of several testcases, as is shown in the tree view.
        In the configuration procedure, you should configure both problems and testcases.
    </p>
    <img src="img/Mainpage_Problems.png" align="middle" height="480" width="600"/>
    <h4>The Dropdown List</h4>
    <p>
        SILICA provides a dropdown list, which simplifies the configuration efficiently.
    </p>
    <img src="img/Dropdown.png" border="1" />
    <p>
        The dropdown list will pop up when you click one of those input boxes,
        and the items in the list will be sorted descending in correlation with the input.
    </p>
    <!--
    TODO
    <p>
        You can use the <b>UP</b> and <b>DOWN</b> arrow keys to navigate within then
        items in the list. The selected item will be highlighted.
    <p>
    <p>
        When you press <b>ENTER</b>, the content in the inputbox will be the item you
        selected, and then hides the dropdown list.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>NOTE</strong>: if you click the list, the dropdown list will hide
        without changing the content of the inputbox. This will be improved in the
        following releases.
